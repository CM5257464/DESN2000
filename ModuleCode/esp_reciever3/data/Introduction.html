			<h1>Scenario</h1>
				<p>Global temperatures are increasing. Sea levels are rising. Species are going extinct. And we need your help to solve the climate crisis.  

				Welcome to Energyville, a small town with a population of 1500 people located on the outskirts of Sydney, characterised by low to moderate winds year-round and sunny summers. Currently, the energy outlook is: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>Annual demand of <b>120 MWh</b> supplied by a coal fired power station </li>
				<li>Annual cost of <b>$75k</b></li>
				<li>Releases enough CO2 to fill <b>10</b> Olympic swimming pools </li>
				</ul>
				<p>As an energy expert, you are being called upon to transition the town&rsquo;s current energy generation to the highest contribution of renewable energy possible. To achieve this, you have 5 portions you can spend across the three renewable energy sources, but only maximum of 3 on any one option. You must use all portions by and choose wisely because there is no going back! </p>
